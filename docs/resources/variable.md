Variable can be either a Terraform variable or an Environment variable.
 Terraform variables, which are defined in the Terraform configuration files and have their values set by ControlMonkey when running IaC commands. 
Environment variables, which are set by ControlMonkey in the shell running IaC commands

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cm_variable" "var_stack" {
  scope          = "stack"
  scope_id       = "stk-123"
  key            = "TfProvider2"
  type           = "tfVar"
  value          = "Value1"
  is_sensitive   = false
  is_overridable = false
}


resource "cm_variable" "var_namespace" {
  scope          = "namespace"
  scope_id       = "ns-123"
  key            = "TfProvider"
  type           = "tfVar"
  value          = "Value2"
  is_sensitive   = false
  is_overridable = false
}


resource "cm_variable" "var_template" {
  scope          = "template"
  scope_id       = "tmpl-123"
  key            = "Value_template1"
  type           = "tfVar"
  value          = "Value3"
  is_sensitive   = false
  is_overridable = true
  is_required    = true
}


resource "cm_variable" "var_org" {
  scope          = "organization"
  key            = "orgKey"
  type           = "envVar"
